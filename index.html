    <img src="src.png">

    <p> </p>
</body>LESCO cannot support or handle for any type of online fraud of scam. It’s 100% responsibility of consumer to check the website secure connection. Most of the banks including MCB Bank, United Bank Ltd. Askari Bank, National Bank, Bank Alfalah, Faysal Islamic Bank, HBL Bank, Soneri Bank, Bank of Khyber and all commercial banks has their own internet banking apps which their consumers normally use for their routine payments and they have modules of utility bills which are in their native apps which are available on google play store and consumer knows that they create a benifishery account which is secured by 3D security and after that system automatically fetch their bill details, like due date and amount due etc. So it’s a normal practice in all native apps that consumers pay their utility bills through internet web banking or native internet banking app, even they can schedule payments of utility bills through their apps, so there is no hassel for banking users to pay their bills by visiting banks of jazzcash or easypaisa shops etc. and we recommend if you are paying your bills through credit card or debit card on any website then check a lock sign in url as mentioned in above image example that will ensure that your credit card or debit card details will not keep in website’s owner database. The best recommended method to pay bills is through online banking apps because they are most secure methods till date and no serious complaints received to pay their bills through this method.
